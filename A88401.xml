            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>I would thine had dropt out too, before ever thou hadst seen this, and if this be your news, you might have kept it, with a pox to you.</p>

               <p>I cry thee heartily mercy, honest Rulerost, I am sorry for what I said, it was my passion made me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get my self so much: but I hope this command as you speake, will not continue long, will it thinke you Master Cooke?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fr.</speaker>
               <p>Truely it is much to be feared; but what do you think will become of us then, if these times hold?</p>

               <p>'Faith, Master Froth, we must shut up our doors and hang padlocks on them, and never so much as take leave of our Land-lords.</p>

               <p>Master Ruierost, I jumpe with you in opinion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156867:3"/> for if I tarry in my house till quarter-day, my Land-lord, I feare, will provide me a house gratis. I am very unwilling to trust him, he was alwayes wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full kind, and ready to help any of his debtors to such a curtisie; to be plaine with you, I know not in which of the Compters I shall keep my Christmas, if I doe not wisely by running away prevent him.</p>

               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>Thou hast spoke my owne thoughts, but I stand not so much in danger of my griping Land-lord, as I doe of Master Kill-calfe my Butcher, I am run into almost halfe a yeares arrerages wi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <speaker>Fr.</speaker>
               <p>I my selfe am almost as farre in debt to my Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as you are to your Butcher; I had almost forgotten that, I see I am no man of this World; if I tarry in England: He hath often threatned to make dice of my bones already, but ile prevent him; ile shew him the bagg, I warrant him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fr.</speaker>
               <p>I much wonder, Master Rulerost why my trade should be put downe, it being so necessary in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: why, the noble art of drinking, it is the soule of all good fellowship, the marrow of a Poets Minervs, it makes a man as valiant as <hi>Hercules,</hi> though he were as cowardly as a French man; besides, I could prove it necessary for any man sometimes to be drunk, for suppose you should kill a man when you are drunk, you shall never be hanged for it untill you are sober; therefore I thinke it good for a man to be alwayes drunk: and besides it is the kindest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and friendliest sin of all the seven; for most fins leave a man by some accident or other, before
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156867:4"/> his death. But this will never forsake him till the breath be out of his body: and lastly, a full bowle of strong beere will drowne all sorrowes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Co,</speaker>
               <p>Master Nick, you are mistaken, your trade is not put downe as you seeme to say; what <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s done, is done to a good intent; to the end that poore men that worke hard all the weeke for a little money, should not spend it all on the Sunday while they should be at some Church, and so consequently there will not be so many Beggers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fr.</speaker>
               <p>Alack you know all my profit doth arise onely upon Sundays, let them but allow me that priviledge, and abridge me all the weeke besides: S'foot, I could have so scowred my young sparks up for a peny a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Can, or a halfe pint, heapt with froth. I got more by uttering halfe a Barrell in time of Divine service, then I could by a whole Barrell at any other time, for my customers were glad to take any thing for money, and thinke themselves much ingaged to me; but now the case is altered.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>Truely Master Froth, you are a man of a Light constitution, and not so much to be blamed as I that am more solid: O what will b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>come of me! I now thinke of the lusty Surloines of roast Beefe which I with much policy divided into an innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of semy slices, by which, with my provident wife, I used to make eighteene pence of that which cost me but a groat (provided that I sold it in service time,) I could tell you too, how I used my halfe Cans and my Bloomesbury Pots, when occasion served; and my Smoak which I sold dearer then any Apothecary doth his Physick: but those happy dayes are now past, and therefore no more of that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Well, I am rid of one charge which did continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vex me by this meanes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fr.</speaker>
               <p>Why Master Rulerost, I was wont to be in see with the Apparitors, because they should not bring me into the Bawdy Court for selling drinke on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes. Ile assure you they used to have a Noble a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of me, but now they shall excuse me, they are like to have no more quartridge of me, and indeed the truth is, their trade begins to be out of request aswell as ours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>I, trust me neighbour, I pity them; I was as much troubled with those kind of Rascals as your self, onely I confesse I paid them no quartridge, but they tickled my beefe, a stone of beef was no more in one of their bellies, then a man in <hi>Pauls;</hi> but now I must take occasion to ease my self of that charge; and with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I will now bid them, Walke knave, walke.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fr.</speaker>
               <p>Truely Master Rulerost, it doth something ease my mind when I thinke that we have companions in misery. Authority I perceive is quick sighted, it can quickly espie a hole in a knaves coate. But Master Cooke we forget our selves, it groweth neare sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time, and we must part, I would tell you what I intend to doe, but time prevents me, therefore ile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it untill the next time we meet; And so farewell.</p>
